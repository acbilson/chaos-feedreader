Minimal requirements to deploy the Miniflux feedreader to my private cloud.

## Appreciation

When I first deployed the Miniflux feedreader, I thought it would be a novelty soon forgotten. How wrong I was! I'm indebted to Frédéric Guillot for this wonderful tool.

As a developer, part of me wants to run off and write my own RSS feedreader, but it's so far down the priority list that I anticipate using [miniflux](https://github.com/miniflux/v2) for years to come.
